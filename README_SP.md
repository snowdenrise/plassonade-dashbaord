# Dashboard de Plassonade
El padre de la Inteligencia Ambiental (AmI), Mark Weiser, dijo:
> Las tecnologÃ­as mÃ¡s profundas son aquellas que desaparecen. Se entrelazan en el tejido de la vida cotidiana hasta que son indistinguibles de ella.

La intenciÃ³n detrÃ¡s de este dashboard es mostrar solo la informaciÃ³n necesaria (no datos crudos) de manera concisa y comprensible para el usuario final del "Hogar Inteligente / Smart Home".

En un "Hogar Inteligente / Smart Home" ideal, los dashboards no serÃ­an necesarios. Sin embargo, hay momentos en los que todavÃ­a necesitas tomar tu telÃ©fono inteligente para ajustar algunas cosas. 

Â¡AsÃ­ que hagamos un dashboard genial!

ðŸš§ Esto es un trabajo en progreso, actualizarÃ© este repositorio regularmente a medida que el dashboard cambie ðŸš§

## Room card

![Room card](room_card/room_card.jpg)

The intention was to have a functional and minimal card to check the status of each room at a glance.
It is also a shortcut to a more detailed view (dashboard) for each room, which is perfect for a small screen (smartphone) display.
I've designed a small card, that I duplicated for each room, and all put together in a grid component.

Each card displays:
- The light state of the room (if any light is on, the room logo will be lit up to the color of the lights);
- The temperature of the specific room;
- If presence is detected or not in that room.

Controls:
- By clicking on the room you can turn on/off the lights inside it;
- Clicking on the arrow will redirect you to the approriate dashboard.

To make this work, you just need to replace the entities for each of your rooms and copy/paste the card in the grid if you have more rooms to manage.
Also, you need to create a dashboard for each room that you will navigate to when tapping on the arrow.


## Climate control and Weather card

![Climate control and Weather card](climate_card/climate_card.png)

The goal was to concatenate a few things into a single card:
- Air conditioning control and status (on/off/heat/cold/dry/temperature);
- Air conditioning presets (none/eco/boost);
- Inside temperature vs. outside temperature;
- Local weather: temperature and conditions;
- Possibility to turn on/off an automation*

*This automation allows me to turn on and off the A/C if presence is detected, and automatically adjust the temperature depending on how far residents are from the A/C.
